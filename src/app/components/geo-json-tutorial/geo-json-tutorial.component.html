            <h3> What is GeoJSON? </h3>
            <p>GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. A GeoJSON object may 
              represent a geometry, a feature, or a collection of features. GeoJSON supports the following 
              geometry types: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and 
              GeometryCollection. Features in GeoJSON contain a geometry object and additional properties, 
              and a feature collection represents a list of features.</p>
            <p>A complete GeoJSON data structure is always an object (in JSON terms). In GeoJSON, an object 
              consists of a collection of name/value pairs – also called members. For each member, the name 
              is always a string. Member values are either a string, number, object, array or one of the 
              literals: true, false, and null. An array consists of elements where each element is a value 
              as described above.</p>
              <p>GeoJSON always consists of a single object. This object represents a geometry, feature, or collection of features. </p>
            <h3>Geometry Object</h3>
            <p>A geometry is a GeoJSON object where the type member’s value is one of the following strings: "Point", "MultiPoint", "LineString", "MultiLineString", "Polygon", "MultiPolygon", or "GeometryCollection". </p>
