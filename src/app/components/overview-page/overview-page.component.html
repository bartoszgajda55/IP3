            This page will present you with current weather condition in designated location. By default it will be Glasgow, but you have an option to
            choose your own location by typing its name, or by providing coordinates. Additionaly, the application can also fetch you location
            automatically, if you will allow it to get your location. This functionality works in Web, but also on Mobile. Such functionality is part
            of Progressive Web Application ability set.

            As an extra feature implemented in the app, it will fetch the 5 day forecast for selected location, if available. This forecast will
            present similar amount of information as the current weather. The forecast presenter, will also display temperate chart, showing the
            temperature trend over the day, in 3 hour increments.

            This page will present you with information about earthquakes from the whole globe. This information can be filtered to see eartquakes
            from a day, week or whole month. All of the data, will be displayed as markers on the map, showing them in clusters if there is many of
            them happening in close to each other. Every marker will also present some brief information about the event, like closest address and the
            magnitude of the earthquake.

            on a location you are looking at. Every layer has a short description, that introduces the information that will be plotted over the map.
